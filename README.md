# tindog
This is a project I created. A tindog version for dogs. Came a long way through. Started from html, then jumped to css but all that helped me build basics sites until
I came across bootstrap. It made things a lot easier. The bootstrap library is vast and I surely need to explore it more. it was really fun to amke a such a project. This is the final project in the journey of my front end learning. Learning backend and will make further developments in my previous websites and make new things that come to my mind. Thanks a lot for checking out my work.
